/**
 * Real posts from Sridhar Vembu's X account (@svembu, https://x.com/svembu).
 *
 * The `text`, `createdAt` and `sourceUrl` of every entry below are genuine —
 * text is quoted verbatim from the public post, and the date is decoded from
 * the tweet's snowflake id. Engagement figures (reactions, comments, shares,
 * views) are NOT real: X does not expose them without an API key, so they are
 * illustrative placeholders like the rest of the mock data in this folder.
 *
 * Entries ending in an ellipsis are excerpts of longer threads, not the full
 * post. The `sourceUrl` field keeps the permalink to the complete original as
 * provenance; it is no longer surfaced in the UI.
 *
 * This is a hand-verified sample, NOT his full timeline. To load the real
 * archive see scripts/import-x-posts.mjs.

/**
 * Thematic images for the feed.

 * Stock photographs from the project's existing image set. Each was opened and
 * identified before being assigned — the captions already in this repo were
 * unreliable (one "team at work" is a robot, one "rocket test rig" is Mars), so
 * subjects here are described from the actual image.
 *
 * These are NOT the media attached to the original tweets, which is not
 * retrievable without API access. Captions describe the photograph only.
